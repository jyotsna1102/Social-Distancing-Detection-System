# Social Distancing Detection System

This project aims to develop a system for detecting social distancing violations in public spaces using computer vision techniques.

## Overview

The Social Distancing Detection System utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze video streams from surveillance cameras in real-time. It detects the presence of individuals in the video frames, estimates their distances from each other, and alerts authorities if social distancing violations are detected.

## Features

- Real-time detection of individuals in video streams
- Estimation of distances between individuals
- Detection and alerting of social distancing violations
